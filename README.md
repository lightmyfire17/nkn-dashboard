# New Kind Of Dashboard
New Kind Of Dashboard â€” web dashboard for NKN users, containing the following features:

* Balance Check

## Node Tracking
To start tracking state of nodes, you need to add the ip addresses of your nodes into the script via following steps:

1) Go to `nkn-dashboard/js`
2) Open core script file `common.js`
3) Find line 41 and add ip of your node into array:
```Line 41
nodes: ['142.93.142.26', '167.99.2.183']
```
4) Save changes and reload page

> You can add as many nodes as you want.

## Wallets Tracker
To start tracking balance of your wallet, you need to add the NKN address and name of your wallet into the script via following steps:

1) Go to `nkn-dashboard/js`
2) Open core script file `common.js`
3) Find line 45 and add ip of your node into array:
```Line 45
